# C# Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/MtSoftDevSolutions/C-sharp-.NET-Training/tree/master/CarInsurance4ptProject)
- [Twenty-One/Blackjack](https://github.com/MtSoftDevSolutions/C-sharp-.NET-Training/tree/master/TwentyOne)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates
a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Twenty-One/Blackjack
This project exposed me to many of the common concepts of C# while building a console application game. Through the game I learned exception handling
and logic. This project could potentially lead to other similar projects involving card games.
